# recipePrj-Mongo-reactive
This is the Recipe Project on MongoDB and Reactive driver of the course that I code along when taking the Udmey course "Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru"

The course video was created in 2017-18, some of the software version used in the course video is a bit old (eg JDK 8 JUnit4, Bootstrap3), in this code-along exercise I try to use the latest software version available to-date (Jan 2022) as far as possible.

* Springboot 2.6
* OpenJDK 11
* JUnit 5
* Bootstrap 5
* MongoDB 4
* Gradle 7
